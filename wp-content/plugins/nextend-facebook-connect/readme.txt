Nextend Social Login is a professional, easy to use and free WordPress plugin. It lets your visitors  register and login to your site using their social profiles instead of forcing them to spend valuable time to fill out the default registration form. Besides that, they don't need to wait for validation emails or keep track of their username and password anymore.

Nextend Social Login seamlessly integrates with your existing WordPress login and registration form. Existing users can add or remove their social accounts at their WordPress profile page. A single user can attach as many social account as they want allowing them to log in with Facebook, Google or Twitter.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How can I get the email address from the Twitter users? =
After you set up your APP go to the Settings tab and enter the URL of your Terms of Service and Privacy Policy page. Then hit the Update your settings button. Then go to the Permissions tab and check the "Request email addresses from users" under "Additional Permissions". [There's a documentation](https://nextendweb.com/nextend-social-login-docs/provider-twitter/#get-email) that explains the process with screenshots.


= 2. Why are random email addresses generated for users registering with their FaceBook account? =
When the user tries to register with their Facebook account Facebook pops up a window where each user can view what kind of access they give for the app. In this modal they can chose not to share their email address. When they're doing so we generate a random email address for them. They can of course change this at their profile.
If the permission is given to the app, there are still [other factors](https://nextendweb.com/nextend-social-login-docs/provider-facebook/#get-email) which can result Facebook not sending back any email address.

In the Pro Addon it's possible to ask an email address if it's not returned by Facebook.

= 3. What should I do when I experience any problems? =
[Contact us](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/) via email and explain the issue you have.

= 4. How can I translate the plugin? =
Find the `.pot` file at the /languages folder. From that you can start the translation process. [Drop us](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/) the final `.po` and `.mo` files and we'll put them to the next releases.

= 5. I have a feature request... =
That's awesome! [Contact us](https://nextendweb.com/contact-us/) and let's discuss the details.

= 6. Does Nextend Social Login work with BuddyPress? =
Unfortunately, currently there are no BuddyPress specific settings. However your users will still be able login and register at the normal WordPress login page. Then when logged in they can use every BuddyPress feature their current user role have access to.
